# JavaScript Cookbook 2nd edition Examples

Each chapter's examples are located in its own subdirectory. The example code includes media files, photos, and other material to allow you to reproduce the book examples as closely as possible.

Node examples don't include Node modules, which you will need to install separately. 

Do let me know if you spot a problem with an example. Feedback always welcome.
